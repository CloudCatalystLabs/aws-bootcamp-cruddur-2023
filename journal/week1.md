## Homework Challenges:

None

## Troubleshooting:

AWS CLI:

Upon performing required homework, my gitpod project was not reflecting the AWS CLI as being installed.

At first I tried to manually install the AWS CLI in the terminal by copying and pasting files.

The output was repeatedly asking me if I wanted to overwrite each file. I used control C to exit the command. 

I verified that the installation files were downloaded in the proper directory.

I then closed out of Gitpod and reloaded my instance. The AWS CLI successfully installed and I verified with the aws --version command.

After this I had zero problems with AWS CLI.

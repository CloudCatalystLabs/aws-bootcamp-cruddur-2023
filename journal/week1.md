## Career Session:

Interested in the Analyst/Manager and Engineer groups.

I am going to become a Cloud Engineer before moving on to a Cloud Security Engineer.

I am a good fit for these roles because I have 5 years in IT and Cybersecurity positions. I have all 3 Associate level AWS certs, and many CompTIA certs including CySA+ and Security+. I need to learn how to transfer my security experience to the cloud, and am really interested in GRC. But, I want to learn how AWS really works for context into learning how to secure it.

I will know:

Python, Github, Linux, Terraform and Networking

I will not get distracted by:

Azure, GCP, any additional certifications, the TryHackMe platform (security) or Jenkins, Chef, Puppet etc.

## Homework Challenges:

None

## Troubleshooting:

AWS CLI:

Upon performing required homework, my gitpod project was not reflecting the AWS CLI as being installed.

At first I tried to manually install the AWS CLI in the terminal by copying and pasting files.

The output was repeatedly asking me if I wanted to overwrite each file. I used control C to exit the command. 

I verified that the installation files were downloaded in the proper directory.

I then closed out of Gitpod and reloaded my instance. The AWS CLI successfully installed and I verified with the aws --version command.

After this I had zero problems with AWS CLI.
